Txt-to-C-
=========

<h1>Text to C Sharp</h1>

This app is meant to be used to take text and make it into console text.
It works for what I need it to

The path that is currently hard coded is C:\test\

This is great for getting Ascii art into your text adventures, or things where you would like 
allot of text and have it in your console app.

With a few mods it would be file for converting text to more formats.

Maybe in the future in another app until then 


Live long and Prosper
